			<p class='large'>In 2016, I co-led the design team for the Hack@Brown hackathon. We developed a common design language and then applied it to a website, posters, promotional materials and apparel.</p>

			<h2>Building a brand identity</h2>
			<p>In October of 2015, we met in a room at RISD and sketched out the core values our brand needed to communicate. I don’t have the exact notes, but they crystallized down in my mind to these 4:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Inclusive and approachable</strong> — we strove to put on an inclusive event, including participants from under-represented identities in tech and participants with different levels of experience.</li>
				<li><strong>Sophisticated, but not intimidating</strong> — Our brand had to be cool enough that you wouldn’t feel embarrassed to tell your friends you’re spending the weekend working on your laptop in a big crowded room. We also had to communicate that just because Hack@Brown is open to people from different backgrounds doesn’t mean it isn’t as technically saavy or impressive as other hackathons.</li>
				<li><strong>More than technical</strong> — I think Chén, our design director last year, put this well in his writeup of last year’s design: “We’re grounded in technology, but don’t idolize its existence.” Our materials needed to make it clear that Hack@Brown is about technology, but not just code— design, creativity, and the humanities are just as important.</li>
				<li><strong>Fun</strong> — Hack@Brown isn’t about competition; it’s about learning, building, enjoying yourself and meeting new people. We don’t think you need fancy prizes to get a bunch of college kids to spend their entire weekend learning building things.</li>
			</ol>

		<p class='large'>As a team, we brainstormed various visual styles, looking for something that reflected those values:</p>

		<p class='large'>Eventually, we settled on a set of colors, a typeface, and a paper motif – confetti, and a paper treatment of our existing logo:</p>

		</section>
		<section>
			<p>The various brand elements were versatile enough to allow us to produce a wide variety of graphic material that felt fresh and diverse but was clearly part of the same brand – I produced some of these, and other members of the team produced the rest:</p>

		<section>
			<h1 class='large'>Hack@Brown on the web</h1>
			<div class='centered-blocks'>
				<p>While I wasn't building mockups for the Hack@Brown website myself, I <em>did</em> provide direction and suggest priorities for the project. Together, we decided that showing <em>imagery and video</em> to prospective attendees was paramount, to counter many peoples' negative assumptions of what hackathons are like.</p>

			</div>
			<div class='centered-blocks'>
				<img src='/hab/hscroll-small.gif' style='max-width: 250px' class='light-shadow'/>
				<p>I also provided input on the site's navigational structure – rather than separating FAQ, schedule and testimonials on separate pages, we built a single-page site that used horizontal scrolling on mobile to reduce the vertical height of sections.</p>

			<h2>Variations on the brand</h2>
			<p>For a week of workshops leading up to the hackathon, I used <a href='clara.io'>Clara.io</a> to create a series of ray-traced 3d promotional images that, while visually distinct from the hackathon, still evoked the brand:</p>
			<img src='/hab/hackweek.png' class='full'/>
			<p>Likewise, I designed a series of posters for day-of events that had their own unique identity while staying true to the brand:</p>

			<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>
				Hack@Brown 2016 went really well, and our design played a big part in attracting the right attendees and setting the tone of the event. The team worked really well together – our two non-lead members are staying on to lead the design team for 2017. It's probably just a coincidence that <a href='https://hackprinceton.com/'>at</a> <a href='http://www.yhack.org/'>least</a> <a href='http://www.hackru.org/'>three</a> hackathons are using Circular as part of their branding for the next year – but we've heard from plenty of other design teams that Hack@Brown's design was successful and influential.
